# Programmeerproject
Final app project for the minor programmeren

I want to make an interactive story app.
It tells a story through text and images and provides the user with choices along the way.

In the above picture you can see the basic idea, the different background colours signify changes in the UI affected by choices made in the story.

Programming-wise it will not be very difficult so I thought about some extra features: including an unlockable story/sidestory choice, adding sounds and/or animations to the story. Perhaps introducing a save-file system so that users can safe their progress and continue on a later moment in their story.
