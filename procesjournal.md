09-01: Thought of an idea I would like to make into an app. An interactive story, like a text-based-game.
10-01: The app is going to have a safe-file system and a single screen into which the story is displayed, Martijn gives the OK for this.
11-01: Started seeing of the basic functionality is possible, meaning a single screen with scrolling text and a button to make more text appear.
12-01: I have the scrolling text ready and made a welcome screen in some free time, the welcome screen has a custom dialog to prompt the user for his name which serves a the name for the file under which user story-progress is saved.
13-01: tried to implement firebase but not sure if I want to use firebase for this app
16-01: Im using sharedprefences now for saving the users progress, users can select their file and their progress is saved under a key-value pair, users create their key and the saved progress is the value.
17-01: Sharedpreferences keys now show up in a listview for the user to select his/her name from.
18-01: SharedPrefs hold filename + value, value corresponds to progress in story. Story_activity no longer works with scrollview and multiple textviews but with a scrollable textview. Work on buttons: they are mutually exclusive and clickable only once. Still needs work: they have to become clickable again when the next choice has to be made, and they have to have a different text and effect on the story.
