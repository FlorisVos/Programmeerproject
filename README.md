# Programmeerproject
Final app project for the minor programmeren

I want to make an interactive story app.
It tells a story through text and images and provides the user with choices along the way.

In the above picture you can see the basic idea, the different background colours signify changes in the UI affected by choices made in the story.

Programming-wise it will not be very difficult so I thought about some extra features: including an unlockable story/sidestory choice, adding sounds and/or animations to the story. Perhaps introducing a save-file system so that users can safe their progress and continue their story on a later moment.

#Technical report
The crux of the programming work will be centered around creating a save file and saving your story progress. I want to save the story after each choice made in the story. I think something like firebase will work for this where you can create a username for a new story, or click on an existing username to continue their story. The choices made can be stored in the database under the username.
